File Format:
-----------

ROMs are stored either in a Chip16 ROM file (.c16), or a raw binary file (preferred .bin, also .c16).
The ROM file stores a 16-byte header, and the binary data after that.
Emulators should load ROM headers for internal use, and only use the binary data for emulation.
Binary data is always loaded at address 0x0000.

The header is as follows (0x00 - 0x0F) :
- 0x00: Magic number 'CH16'
- 0x04: Reserved
- 0x05: Spec version (high nibble=major, low nibble=minor, so 0.7 = 0x07 and 1.0 = 0x10)
- 0x06: Rom size (excl. header, in bytes)
- 0x0A: Start address (initial value of PC)
- 0x0C: CRC32 checksum (excl. header, polynom = 0x04c11db7)

- 0x10: Start of Chip16 raw rom, end of header

CPU:
-----

1x 16 bit program counter (PC)
1x 16 bit stack pointer (SP)
16x 16 bit general purpose registers (R0 - RF)
1x 8 bit flag register

Machine uses little-endian byte ordering.

All opcodes take exactly 1 cycle to execute.
CPU speed is 1 Mhz.

GPU:
-----
60 FPS, raises an internal VBlank flag each frame (~16 ms) which the CPU can wait-on with the VBLNK instruction.
Resolution is 320x240 pixels with 4 bit indexed color.
Along with a primary layer is a background layer which can be set to only 1 color index.
Screen does not wrap. Everything that is offscreen stays offscreen.
Sprites can be drawn to negative coordinates, so that a 4x4 pixel sprite drawn at (-2,-2),
will show 2x2 pixels on the top-left part of the screen.

Sprites are byte coded color indexes. 1 Byte represents a block of 2 pixels.
For example, if the sprite height and width are set to 2 the sprite is 4 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall.
Higher nibble is the left pixel and lower nibble is the right pixel.

If a new sprite overlaps any existing pixel (other then 0 - transparent) carry flag is raised.

Custom user palettes can be used besides the default one. Palettes can be stored in 3-byte, RGB format (bytes in that order). 
There are 16 colors so the PAL instruction will read 48 bytes for the palette, and assign RGB values to the color indexes in ascending 
order (0x0,0x1...0xF). Loading a palette affects everything that has been drawn since the last VBlank.

SPU:
-----
Two options are available:
- Playing one of 3 fixed tones (500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz) for a given number of milliseconds, OR
- Using sound generation options (SNG instruction), play a tone from memory for a given number of milliseconds.

Sound generator options are detailed in the SNG opcode description.

Color indexes (0xRRGGBB):
------------------------
0x0 - 0x000000 (Black, Transparent in foreground layer)
0x1 - 0x000000 (Black)
0x2 - 0x888888 (Gray)
0x3 - 0xBF3932 (Red)
0x4 - 0xDE7AAE (Pink)
0x5 - 0x4C3D21 (Dark brown)
0x6 - 0x905F25 (Brown)
0x7 - 0xE49452 (Orange)
0x8 - 0xEAD979 (Yellow)
0x9 - 0x537A3B (Green)
0xA - 0xABD54A (Light green)
0xB - 0x252E38 (Dark blue)
0xC - 0x00467F (Blue)
0xD - 0x68ABCC (Light blue)
0xE - 0xBCDEE4 (Sky blue)
0xF - 0xFFFFFF (White)

Controllers:
-------------
Controllers are accessed through memory mapped I/O ports.
Controller 1: FFF0.
Controller 2: FFF2.

Bit[0] - Up
Bit[1] - Down
Bit[2] - Left
Bit[3] - Right
Bit[4] - Select
Bit[5] - Start
Bit[6] - A
Bit[7] - B
Bit[8 - 15] - Unused (Always zero).

Controller status gets updated each VBlank.

Memory:
--------
64 KB (65536 bytes).

0x0000 - Start of ROM.
0xFDF0 - Start of stack (512 bytes).
0xFFF0 - IO ports.

Flag register:
---------------
Bit[0] - Reserved
Bit[1] - c (Unsigned Carry and Unsigned Borrow flag)
Bit[2] - z (Zero flag)
Bit[3] - Reserved
Bit[4] - Reserved
Bit[5] - Reserved
Bit[6] - o (Signed Overflow Flag)
Bit[7] - n (Negative Flag; aka Sign Flag)

c flag:
- for add - is set when the result would have imaginary bit[16] set, else its cleared.
- for sub - is set when the operation needed to borrow from bit[16], else its cleared.
- for mul - is set when the result is too big to fit into 16 bits, else its cleared.
- for div - is set when the remainder of the division is non-zero, else it is cleared.

z flag:
- is set when the result is 0, else its cleared.

o flag:
- in general this flag is used when the sign of the result differs from what would be expected.
- for addition it is set when the result is positive and both operands were negative,
or if the result is negative and both operands were positive; else it is cleared.
- for subtraction (x-y=z) it is set when z is positive and x is negative and y is positive,
or if z is negative and x is positive and y is negative; else it is cleared.

n flag:
- it is set when the result is less than 0 (bit[15] == 1); else it is cleared.

Conditional Types:
---------------
The conditions below are used for conditional jumps and conditional calls.
For example: "jle some_label" or "cno some_label"
The condition in brackets refer to the Flag register's flags.

Z   = 0x0 // [z==1]         Equal (Zero)
NZ  = 0x1 // [z==0]         Not Equal (Non-Zero)
N   = 0x2 // [n==1]         Negative
NN  = 0x3 // [n==0]         Not-Negative (Positive or Zero)
P   = 0x4 // [n==0 && z==0] Positive
O   = 0x5 // [o==1]         Overflow
NO  = 0x6 // [o==0]         No Overflow
A   = 0x7 // [c==0 && z==0] Above       (Unsigned Greater Than)
AE  = 0x8 // [c==0]         Above Equal (Unsigned Greater Than or Equal)
B   = 0x9 // [c==1]         Below       (Unsigned Less Than)
BE  = 0xA // [c==1 || z==1] Below Equal (Unsigned Less Than or Equal)
G   = 0xB // [o==n && z==0] Signed Greater Than
GE  = 0xC // [o==n]         Signed Greater Than or Equal
L   = 0xD // [o!=n]         Signed Less Than
LE  = 0xE // [o!=n || z==1] Signed Less Than or Equal
RES = 0xF // Reserved for future use

Alternative Valid Mnemonics:
C   = 0x9 // [c==1]         Carry     (Same as B)
NC  = 0x8 // [c==0]         Not Carry (Same as GE)
